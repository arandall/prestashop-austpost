This is an Australia Post module that adds the following carriers: 
 	- Australia Post (Standard)
	- Australia Post (Express)
	- Australia Post (Air)
	- Australia Post (Sea)

Those who are familiar with Australia Post know that the estimated delivery 
time is also returned by the API. I have not bothered attempting to add this 
functionality using a hook into the 'ShippingModule' due to the way the delay 
is statically implemented in Prestashop.

To install this module:
1. Copy the 'shippingaustpost' directory to your Prestashop modules directory 
   and install it like you would any other Prestashop module.
2. Click configure to add/remove carriers not required.
3. Ensure your store address details contain the right country and postcode.
4. Go to your carriers tab and you should now see the 'Shipping Module 
   Example' carrier listed. Edit the carrier and add it to the correct zones 
   and give appropriate group access.
5. You are now ready to go. Prestashop will give you the Australia Post 
   carriers when you are making an order.
